Install

When you downloaded the jar file, place it in **an empty directory**.

Now launch it using the `java` command:     
_For users who knows how it works, you can skip the extra steps._

```bash
java -jar mohist-<mcversion>-<buildnumber>-server.jar
```

**You don't know how this works ?**    
Take the command above, replace `<mcversion>` by the version you downloaded (1.12.2, 1.16.5 or 1.7.10), and replace `<buildnumber>` by the build number.    

How to run this command ?     
Open file explorer to your server folder, and then press `shift` and `right click` button, and open with command prompt (CMD), and paste the command above.
